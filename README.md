Web-based visualiser for camera's field of view

I have been committing on the main branch given there is a single developer working on this.

TODO

- [ ] Preset camera views should get the centroid of the bounding box of all elements in the scene rather than 0,0,5

- [ ] Preset views but with top and bottom views.

- [ ] Dark theme.
